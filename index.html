                Notice of Cybersecurity Incident
                <br />
                <i>As of Nov. 9 at 8:00am</i>
            </p>
            <p class="para-content">
                On October 31, Mr. Cooper experienced a cybersecurity incident. Our team took immediate steps to lock down our systems, and we are working around the clock with cybersecurity experts to resolve this issue as soon as possible.
                <br />
                <br />
                As part of our ongoing investigation, we now believe that certain customer data was exposed. We are continuing to investigate precisely what information was exposed. In the coming weeks, we will mail notices to any affected customer and provide them with complimentary credit monitoring services.
                <br />
                <br />
                Until that time, it is always advisable to monitor your financial accounts and credit reports for any unauthorized activity. You should immediately report any unusual activity to your financial institution. You can also contact the three major credit bureaus to place a “fraud alert” on your file at no cost, which alerts creditors to contact you before they open a new credit account under your Social Security number. Additionally, you should update your passwords frequently and with increasing complexity, and be mindful to not use the same password across multiple personal accounts.
                <br />
                <br />
                Once again, we apologize for any inconvenience or concern this situation may have caused.
            </p>
